## 🎯 Current Priority: GTK3 Migration

**Status**: Planned and ready to start  
**Plan**: See `docs/gtk3-migration-plan.md` for complete step-by-step guide  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks  
**Risk**: High (complex API changes)

### Next Session Prompt
> Start the GTK2 to GTK3 migration following `docs/gtk3-migration-plan.md`. Begin with Phase 1: Build System Preparation. Update Makefile to use gtk+-3.0, fix header includes, and identify all deprecated API usage.

### Phase 1: GTK3 Migration (In Progress)

**Background**: Pho currently uses GTK+ 2.0 which is deprecated and no longer maintained. Migration to GTK3 is essential for long-term viability.

#### Current Status (2026-02-15)
- ✅ Branch `gtk3-migration-phase1` created
- ✅ Build system updated (Makefile uses gtk+-3.0)
- ✅ Header includes updated in pho.h
- ✅ Compilation attempted - **47 errors identified** (see docs/todo.md)

#### Tasks
1. **Research GTK3 API differences** ✅
   - ✅ Deprecated functions identified (see compilation report below)
   - ✅ Map GTK2 → GTK3 replacements documented
   - Note behavioral changes

2. **Update build system** ✅
   - ✅ Modify Makefile for GTK3
   - ✅ Update pkg-config calls
   - ✅ Handle macOS/Linux differences (GTK3 installed via Homebrew)

3. **Fix compilation errors** (47 errors across 6 files)
   - `gmain.c` - Key symbol constants (GDK_f → GDK_KEY_f)
   - `gwin.c` - Widget struct access, Cairo drawing
   - `gdialogs.c` - Signal handlers, widget visibility checks
   - `keydialog.c` - Signal handlers, hbox deprecation
   - `winman.c` - X11-specific headers (gdk/gdkx.h)
   - `focustest.c` - X11-specific headers (gdk/gdkx.h)

4. **Update drawing/rendering**
   - Replace `gdk_pixbuf_render_to_drawable` with Cairo
   - Use Cairo for drawing operations
   - Handle HiDPI displays

5. **Test on multiple platforms**
   - macOS (primary development)
   - Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
   - Verify all display modes work

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks  
**Risk**: High (complex API changes)

---

### Phase 2: Enhanced Image Formats (Medium Priority)

**Background**: Currently relies on GDK pixbuf loaders. Better format support would improve user experience.

#### Tasks
1. **WebP support**
   - Add WebP loading via libwebp
   - Preserve metadata

2. **HEIF/HEIC support**
   - Add HEIF loading for modern camera files
   - Handle orientation correctly

3. **SVG support**
   - Basic SVG rendering
   - Respect viewBox dimensions

4. **RAW format detection**
   - Identify RAW files even if can't display
   - Show appropriate error/warning

**Estimated Effort**: 1 week  
**Risk**: Low (well-documented libraries)

---

### Phase 3: Performance Improvements (Medium Priority)

#### Tasks
1. **Thumbnail caching**
   - Cache scaled thumbnails for large collections
   - Store in XDG_CACHE_HOME

2. **Async image loading**
   - Load images in background thread
   - Show spinner while loading
   - Maintain UI responsiveness

3. **Image prefetching**
   - Preload next/prev images
   - Configurable cache size

4. **Optimize rotation**
   - Use hardware acceleration where available
   - Cache rotated versions

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks  
**Risk**: Medium (threading complexity)

---

### Phase 4: New Features (Low Priority / Nice to Have)

#### 4.1 Slideshow Enhancements
- Transition effects (fade, slide)
- Configurable timing per image
- Random slide order option
- Pause on mouse movement

#### 4.2 EXIF Improvements
- Display more EXIF fields in info dialog
- Copy EXIF to rotated/modified images
- Strip EXIF option for privacy

#### 4.3 UI/UX Improvements
- Dark mode support
- Configurable keyboard shortcuts
- Mouse gesture support
- Touchscreen support (swipe navigation)

#### 4.4 Export Features
- Batch resize/export
- Export to different formats
- Create contact sheets

---

### Phase 5: Code Modernization (Ongoing)

#### Tasks
1. **Refactor global state**
   - Encapsulate in context structure
   - Reduce global variables
   - Improve testability

2. **Improve error handling**
   - Consistent error codes
   - Better error messages
   - User-facing error dialogs

3. **Code documentation**
   - Add Doxygen comments
   - Document public APIs
   - Architecture overview

4. **Static analysis integration**
   - Add clang-analyzer to CI
   - Address all warnings
   - Set up automated scanning

## 🔧 Maintenance Tasks

### Regular
- [ ] Update dependencies (GTK, libraries)
- [ ] Test on new OS versions
- [ ] Review and merge PRs
- [ ] Update documentation

### As Needed
- [ ] Security audits
- [ ] Performance profiling
- [ ] User feedback integration

## 📋 Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-15 | Completed security fixes | All 21 issues resolved |
| 2026-02-15 | GTK3 migration priority | GTK2 is deprecated, blocking future development |
| 2026-02-15 | Keep C codebase | Rewrite in Rust/modern language would be too disruptive |

## 📝 Notes

### For Contributors
- Always run `make clean && make` before committing
- Add regression tests for bug fixes
- Update documentation for user-facing changes
- Follow existing code style (see AGENTS.md)

### For Maintainers
- Review security implications of new features
- Keep dependencies minimal
